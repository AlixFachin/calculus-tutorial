# First look at limits
Now that we have a good understanding of sequences and of induction theorem, we can start to study limits.
Hopefully understanding limits in a the case of sequences will help us understand limits in the case of functions.
First we will look at concepts with vague definitions, and then we can move to a more formal definition.
Using the formal and exact definition of limits will help us really understand this concept.

# Definition
For a sequence, we mostly want to figure out the behavior of the sequence when $n$ becomes very very large.
Let's suppose that a sequence $a_n$ is definined for all positive integers $n$.
We have four cases:
1. The sequence values can go as high as we want, in this case we say that the sequence diverges to $+\infty$.
1. The sequence values can go as low as we want, in this case we say that the sequence diverges to $-\infty$.
1. The sequence values can get very close to a certain value $L$ (an extreme case is when the sequence is actually equal to $L$ after a certain value).
In this case we say that the sequence converges to $L$.
1. All the other cases (for example, the sequence oscillates between two values), where we can not say anything about the behavior of the sequence.

# Examples
* Arithmetic sequences diverge to $+\infty$ or $-\infty$ depending on the sign of $d$.
* For geometric sequences, if $|r|< 1$, then the sequence converges to $0$. If $r> 1$, then the sequence diverges to $+\infty$ or $-\infty$ depending on the sign of $r$.
But if $r< -1$, then the sequence doesn't have any limits.
We can see that in our graphs
